Using React components, I structured the application efficiently for better code readability and maintenance. JavaScript logic was integrated to handle complex mathematical operations, including error handling for edge cases, resulting in a reliable calculator. Additionally, memory functions were implemented to store and recall previous calculations, enhancing the calculator's functionality for users.</p>
